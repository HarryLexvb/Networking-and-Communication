Create a file named tmux_script.sh in the directory where your server2.exe and client2.exe files are located:

touch script.sh
Open the file with your favorite text editor (e.g. nano, vim, etc.):

nano script.sh
Add the following content to the tmux_script.sh file:

#!/bin/bash

# Start a new tmux session with the name 'my_session'.
tmux new-session -d -s my_session

# Splits the window into two vertical panes
tmux split-window -h

# Run the command 'server2.exe' in the left pane (index 0)
tmux send-keys -t my_session:0.0 './server.exe' C-m

# Runs the command 'client.exe' in the right pane (index 1)
tmux send-keys -t my_session:0.1 './client2.exe' C-m

# Select right pane (index 1)
tmux select-pane -t my_session:0.1

# Attach the tmux session to be visible in the current terminal
tmux attach-session -t my_session

Save the file and close the text editor.

Make the file executable:

chmod +x tmux_script.sh
Run the script in the terminal:
./tmux_script.sh
This will open a tmux session with two panes, it will run ./server2.exe in the left pane and ./client2.exe in the right pane.

Note that you may need to install the tmux package if you do not have it installed on your system. You can install it using the package manager of your Linux distribution, for example, in Arch Linux you can use the command sudo pacman -S tmux.
